I thought a quick Google DuckDuckGo search would solve all my problems, but alas. There was a lot of outdated information that simply didn&amp;rsquo;t work with the Git version I had installed on my computer (or I applied incorrectly).
Finally I found a answer on StackOverflow1 that put me in the right direction, but that also didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description></item></channel></rss>
